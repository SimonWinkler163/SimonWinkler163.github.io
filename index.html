      <p id="content_aboutme">Hi, my name is Simon Winkler, welcome to my website! It showcases my current proficiency in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am currently undergoing retraining as an IT System Management Specialist.  In addition, I am developing my skills in Frontend Development.  
      My goal is to design creative and user-friendly web applications.  I am fascinated by the combination of design and technology and want to use my passion for the digital world to create innovative solutions. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In my training, I am learning the basics of IT infrastructure, network technology and software development, as well as the commercial processes of order processing, customer support and project management. This knowledge helps me to understand how to tailor technical solutions to the needs of users and thus develop effective and user-friendly web applications.
      <br>
      <br>
      Besides my technical skills, I am also a team player and value the exchange with others. 
      I am curious, eager to learn and look forward to new challenges.</p>
